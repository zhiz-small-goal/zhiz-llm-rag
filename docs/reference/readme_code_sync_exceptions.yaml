# README <-> code sync exceptions (tools/).
#
# Purpose:
# - Allow explicit, reviewable exceptions when a README cannot be generated/checked deterministically.
# - Avoid "implicit skip" logic inside the checker.
#
# Format:
# exceptions:
#   - path: tools/some_tool_README.md
#     tool_id: some_tool
#     reason: "why it can't be generated/checked"
#     checks:
#       skip: ["options", "output_contract", "artifacts"]
#     owner: "@team-or-person"
#     review:
#       trigger: "when/why to re-check"
